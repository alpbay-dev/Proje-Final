    <p>
        <strong>BARCODE-ON</strong> is a web-based bioinformatics tool developed as part of the BIO 496 course at Boƒüazi√ßi University.
        It enables users to retrieve DNA barcode sequences from the BOLD Systems API, align them using ClustalW, and generate various analyses such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maximum Likelihood Trees (IQ-TREE)</li>
        <li>Minimum Spanning Networks</li>
        <li>Nucleotide Diversity Heatmaps</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The tool simplifies the barcode-based comparison of species for educational or research purposes.
        Users simply choose species names and a DNA marker, and the platform does the rest ‚Äî from fetching sequences to visualizing evolutionary relationships.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5 text-success">Our Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        We wanted to bridge the gap between biological data and accessibility.
        Many researchers and students struggle with command-line bioinformatics tools.
        Our goal was to offer an intuitive interface to perform standard analyses in a few clicks, combining our interests in biology, data science, and web development.
    </p>

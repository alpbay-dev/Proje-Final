    <p>
        <strong>BARCODE-ON</strong> is a web-based bioinformatics tool developed as part of the BIO 496 course at Boğaziçi University.
        It enables users to retrieve DNA barcode sequences from the BOLD Systems API, align them using ClustalW, and generate various analyses such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maximum Likelihood Trees (IQ-TREE)</li>
        <li>Minimum Spanning Networks</li>
        <li>Nucleotide Diversity Heatmaps</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The tool simplifies the barcode-based comparison of species for educational or research purposes.
        Users simply choose species names and a DNA marker, and the platform does the rest — from fetching sequences to visualizing evolutionary relationships.

    <h2 class="mt-5 text-success">Our Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        We wanted to bridge the gap between biological data and accessibility.
        Many researchers and students struggle with command-line bioinformatics tools.
        Our goal was to offer an intuitive interface to perform standard analyses in a few clicks, combining our interests in biology, data science, and web development.
    </p>
